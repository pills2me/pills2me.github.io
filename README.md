## Overview

The Pills2Me website is built to allow patients to sign up for free same-day medication delivery to their door and for volunteer drivers to offer their time to help. It also provides abundant information about our services, partnership, donations and team. 

## About Pills2Me
We strive to help patients receive the care and medications they need without leaving their home. Our goal is to promote public health and prevent the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) across the country. With COVID-19 spreading and endangering millions across the globe, it is of the utmost importance that we work to protect the most vulnerable populations. As a pharmacist and student at Yale School of Public Health, Leslie Asanga saw this urgent issue and took matters into his own hands to create an innovative solution. He founded Pills2Me to provide free home medication delivery for the elderly or vulnerable who are more likely to develop severe symptoms from COVID-19 per CDC guidelines. We hope that by connecting those in need with volunteer drivers, we can promote public health and help ensure the vulnerable are not at risk for contracting the virus.
